# Frontend

This directory will house the Next.js application (App Router) styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

Planned structure:
- `app/`: server components and routes with SSR/ISR enabled by default.
- `components/`: shared UI primitives.
- `lib/`: data-fetching helpers that hit the API gateway.
- `public/`: static assets.

Initial bootstrap will be handled with `create-next-app` in a future step.
